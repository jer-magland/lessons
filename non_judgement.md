# How can practicing Christ's teachings of non-judgment towards others ease our burdens?

Based on a General Conference talk from Sister J. Anette Dennis: [His Yoke Is Easy and His Burden Is Light](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/general-conference/2022/10/42dennis?lang=eng)

## The moat and the beam

```
Judge not, that ye be not judged.

For with what judgment ye judge, ye shall be judged:
and with what measure ye mete, it shall be measured to you again.

And why beholdest thou the mote that is in thy brother's eye,
but considerest not the beam that is in thine own eye?

Or how wilt thou say to thy brother,
Let me pull out the mote out of thine eye;
and, behold, a beam is in thine own eye?

Thou hypocrite,
first cast out the beam out of thine own eye;
and then shalt thou see clearly
to cast out the mote outof thy brother's eye.

- Matthew 7:5
```

Can you think of a time where you were so focused on finding fault with someone else, that you couldn't see that your own perspective was clouded?

## Love others

"We are commanded to love others, not to judge them.
Let’s lay down that heavy burden; it isn’t ours to carry.
Instead, we can pick up the Savior’s yoke of love and compassion." - Sister Dennis

```
By this shall all men know that ye are my disciples, if ye have love one to another.
- John 13:35
```

## Christ's yoke is easy

```
Come unto me,
all ye that labour and are heavy laden,
and I will give you rest.

Take my yoke upon you, and learn of me; ...
For my yoke is easy, and my burden is light.

- Matthew 11:28-30
```

What are some of the ways your burden has been eased by following the teachings of Christ?
