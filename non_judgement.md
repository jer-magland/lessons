# How can practicing Christ's teachings of non-judgment towards others ease our burdens?

Based on a General Conference talk from Sister J. Anette Dennis: [His Yoke Is Easy and His Burden Is Light](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/general-conference/2022/10/42dennis?lang=eng)

## The moat and the beam

```
Judge not, that ye be not judged.

For with what judgment ye judge, ye shall be judged:
and with what measure ye mete, it shall be measured to you again.

And why beholdest thou the mote that is in thy brother's eye,
but considerest not the beam that is in thine own eye?

Or how wilt thou say to thy brother,
Let me pull out the mote out of thine eye;
and, behold, a beam is in thine own eye?

Thou hypocrite,
first cast out the beam out of thine own eye;
and then shalt thou see clearly
to cast out the mote outof thy brother's eye.

- Matthew 7:5
```

```
Who am I to judge another
when I walk imperfectly?
In the quiet heart is hidden
sorrow that the eye can’t see.

- Susan Evans McCloud
```

Can you think of a time when you were overly focused on finding fault with someone else?

Have you ever felt judged by someone else?

## Love one another

"We are commanded to love others, not to judge them.
Let’s lay down that heavy burden; it isn’t ours to carry.
Instead, we can pick up the Savior’s yoke of love and compassion." - Sister Dennis

```
By this shall all men know that ye are my disciples, if ye have love one to another.
- John 13:35
```

```
Ye will teach [your children]
to walk in the ways of truth and soberness;
ye will teach them to love one another,
and to serve one another.

- King Benjamin
```

When was a time where someone showed love to you?

How can we do a better job making sure everyone in the ward feels loved?

## Christ's yoke is easy

```
Come unto me,
all ye that labour and are heavy laden,
and I will give you rest.

Take my yoke upon you, and learn of me; ...
For my yoke is easy, and my burden is light.

- Matthew 11:28-30
```

What are some of the ways your burden has been eased by following the teachings of Christ?

"When we confront life’s wind and rainstorms, sickness and injuries, the Lord—our Shepherd, our Caregiver—will nourish us with love and kindness. He will heal our hearts and restore our souls." - Gary E. Stevenson

Just as the Lord cares for us, we should care for one another.

What are some ways we can lighten the burden of others?

## Friends or family who leave the Church

“If friends and family … step away from the Church, continue to love them. It is not for you to judge another’s choice any more than you deserve to be criticized for staying faithful.” - Russel M. Nelson

Those who have stepped away from the church can often feel judged.

What are some ways you can show love for them? How can we preserve loving family ties?

## Those who are less fortunate

```
And ye will not have a mind to injure one another, but to live peaceably
And also, ye yourselves will succor those that stand in need of your succor;
ye will administer of your substance unto him that standeth in need;
and ye will not suffer that the beggar putteth up his petition to you in vain, and turn him out to perish.

Perhaps thou shalt say: The man has brought upon himself his misery;
therefore I will stay my hand, and will not give unto him of my food,
nor impart unto him of my substance that he many not suffer, for his punishments are just –

But I say unto you, O man, whosoever doeth this the same hath great cause to repent
For behold, are we not all beggars?
Do we not all depend upon the same Being, even God, for all the substance which we have,
for both food and raiment, and for gold, and for silver,
and for all the riches which we have of every kind?

- King Benjamin
```

Sometimes people bring upon themselves their own misfortune, sometimes not. What Jesus and King Benjamin are teaching us is that it is not ours to judge. We should look introspectively, and realize that if we are to obtain love and mercy, we should be willing to extend love and mercy.

```
Love one another. As I have loved you, so you must love one another.

- John 13:34
```
